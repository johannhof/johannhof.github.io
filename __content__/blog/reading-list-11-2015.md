# {{ title }}

Not much time to read in November, lot's of stuff still saved in my Pocket list, still some things I found entertaining.

_Graham King_ gives us a great compilation of problems that apparently arise from the coding culture at Facebook. I think that the folks at Facebook do an amazing job, but let's enjoy a moment of Schadenfreude anyway [http://www.darkcoding.net/software/facebooks-code-quality-problem/](http://www.darkcoding.net/software/facebooks-code-quality-problem/)

_Mike Ash_ goes great lengths to explain what a String is and why Swift is doing them right [https://www.mikeash.com/pyblog/friday-qa-2015-11-06-why-is-swifts-string-api-so-hard.html](https://www.mikeash.com/pyblog/friday-qa-2015-11-06-why-is-swifts-string-api-so-hard.html)

_DHH_'s slightly populist but very entertaining piece on startup humility [https://m.signalvnoise.com/reconsider-41adf356857f](https://m.signalvnoise.com/reconsider-41adf356857f)

The infamous article that made Google and Mozilla update their Math.random() [https://medium.com/@betable/tifu-by-using-math-random-f1c308c4fd9d#.6v8jm2lmz](https://medium.com/@betable/tifu-by-using-math-random-f1c308c4fd9d#.6v8jm2lmz)

_Jan De Mooij_ completely changed the internals of `this` in Spidermonkey and lives to tell about it [http://jandemooij.nl/blog/2015/11/25/making-this-a-real-binding-in-spidermonkey/](http://jandemooij.nl/blog/2015/11/25/making-this-a-real-binding-in-spidermonkey/)

_Dmitri Sotnikov_ makes a case for dynamically typed languages [http://yogthos.net/posts/2015-11-28-TheSkyIsNotFalling.html](http://yogthos.net/posts/2015-11-28-TheSkyIsNotFalling.html)
